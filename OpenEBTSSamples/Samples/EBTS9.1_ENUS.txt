# Note #2: In Table I-1, the ERRI TOT is included erroneously. It is already specified in table E-1.

			analysis as necessary. \
			The second information item shall be a quantitative expression of the predicted matching \
			performance of the biometric sample. This item contains the ASCII representation of the \
			integer image quality score between 0 and 100 assigned to the image data by a quality \
			algorithm. Higher values indicate better quality. An entry of '255' shall indicate a failed \
			attempt to calculate a quality score. An entry of '254' shall indicate that no attempt to \
			calculate a quality score was made. The use of additional values to convey other \
			information should be harmonized with ISO/IEC 19794 standards. \
			The third information item shall specify the ID of the vendor of the quality algorithm used \
			to calculate the quality score. This 4-digit hex value is assigned by IBIA and expressed \
			as four ASCII characters. The IBIA shall maintain the Vendor Registry of CBEFF \
			Biometric Organizations that will map the value in this field to a registered organization. \
			The fourth information item shall specify a numeric product code assigned by the vendor \
			of the quality algorithm, which may be registered with the IBIA, but registration is not \
			required. It indicates which of the vendor’s algorithms was used in the calculation of the \
			quality score. This field contains the ASCII representation of the integer product code and \
			should be within the range 1 to 65535.";
